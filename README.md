# Welcome to OTTAA Project's Realiser #

The realisation process consists of creating a coherent sentence out of a sequence of individual components, such as nouns, adjectives, subjects or verbs.
OTTAA Project's Realiser carries out this process over the cloud providing an API service. This repository contains all the files and scripts necessary for its development.

## How does it work?

The Realiser server recieves different types of API requests and responds with the results of the realisation process at different stages or carried out under different parameters.
For a detailed explanation on the endpoints of the service and their corresponding request types, see the (API Reference)[]

## Getting started: 

### For users:

We recommend everyone to start testing the service on an API platform or enviroment such as (POSTMAN)[https://www.postman.com/product/what-is-postman] for web or desktop
or (Thunder Client)[https://www.thunderclient.com/] for VSCode.
Once the usecases have been tested and the expected outcome achieved they can be implemented on any app that has access to internet and a Native or External package for managing API requests, such as:
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

### For developers:

Since the server is mounted on Firebase Cloud Functions, most of the code is NodeJS (Javascript), althought a certain Python can be used for local developments, testing or training of ML models, etc
